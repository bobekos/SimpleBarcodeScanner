Barcode Scanner by Google Mobile Vision Api with RxJava

## Please note that this GitHub repository has been archived and is no longer under active development

## Getting Started

### Setting up the dependency

The first step is to include SimpleBarcodeScanner into your project, as a Gradle dependency:
```
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/bobekos/SimpleBarcodeScanner.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#bobekos/SimpleBarcodeScanner)
```
Add the dependency:

implementation 'com.github.bobekos:SimpleBarcodeScanner:x.x.xx'
```

## Usage

### Include following code in your layout:

```xml
<com.bobekos.bobek.scanner.BarcodeView
        android:id="@+id/barcodeView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

For all supported attributes see the list below

### Include followin code in your activity or fragment

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private var mDisposable: Disposable? = null

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }

    override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()

        //make sure to request camera permission before the subscription

        mDisposable = barcodeView
                .getObservable()
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(
                        { barcode ->
                            //handle barcode object
                        },
                        { throwable ->
                            //handle exceptions like no available camera for selected facing
                        })
    }

    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()

        mDisposable?.dispose()
    }
}
```

        custom:setVibration="500"
        />
```

Vibrate at barcode detection. Default value is 500ms. (Also changeable after the subscription)

### Advanced Options

#### isOperationalCheck

Source Google:
```
Indicates whether the detector has all of the required dependencies available locally in order to do detection.

When an app is first installed, it may be necessary to download required files. If this returns false, those files are not yet available. Usually this download is taken care of at application install time, but this is not guaranteed. In some cases the download may have been delayed.
```

By default this case is handled automatic by this library. If you want to handle this case by yourself, make sure to set this function:
```kotlin
.setManualIsOperationalCheck()
```
If this function is set, the DetectorNotReadyException will be thrown in onError if isOperational function of the detector return false.

#### Custom overlay

There a already two implemented overlay views (BarcodeRectOverlay and BarcodeTextOverlay). 
To create your own overlay, you only need to implement the "BarcodeOverlay" interface to your custom view. 
The method "onUpdate" passes the position of the barcode on the screen and its value. An own view looks like this, for example: 

```kotlin
class RedRectOverlay : View, BarcodeOverlay {

    //constructors

    private lateinit var rect: Rect

    private val paint by lazy {
        Paint().apply {
            color = Color.RED
            style = Paint.Style.STROKE
            strokeWidth = TypedValue.applyDimension(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_DIP, 3f, context?.resources?.displayMetrics)
        }
    }

    init {
        setWillNotDraw(false)
    }

    override fun onUpdate(posRect: Rect, barcodeValue: String) {
        rect = posRect
        invalidate()
    }

    override fun onDraw(canvas: Canvas?) {
        super.onDraw(canvas)

        if (::rect.isInitialized) {
            canvas?.drawRect(rect, paint)
        }
    }
}

// Activity or Fragment
barcodeView
	.drawOverlay(RedRectOverlay(this))
```

If the barcode detection failed or finished the "onUpdate" method passed empty values for the position and barcode value.

#### CameraPreview release

The default behavior stops the barcode detection and released the camera when the subscription is disposed.
Sometimes you want to hold the camera preview also after dispose. Mostly if you use for example single or maybe which disposed directly.This function guarantees that the camera preview is not released. In all cases the camera will be released when the surface gets destroyed.

```kotlin
.holdCameraOnDispose()
```

#### Rx

You have full control of the observable which is returned from the BarcodeView.
Nevertheless, I have prepared a few examples to show what is possible.

```
//filter the detected results

.getObservable()
.filter { barcode ->
    barcode.displayValue == "12345"
}
.observeOn...
```

```
//skip results until the raw value changed

.getObservable()
.distinctUntilChanged { barcode1, barcode2 ->
	barcode1.rawValue == barcode2.rawValue
}
.observeOn...
```

```
//get only first item

.getObservable()
.firstOrError()
.observeOn...
```

```
// combine your api/database/etc. observables directly

.getObservable()
.firstOrError()
.flatMap { barcode ->
    ApiService.getDateByBarcodeId(barcode.displayValue)
}
.flatMap ...
```

and many more...

**On which thread does the detection run?**

The detection runs on an background thread. Don't forget to set the correct scheduler to the "observeOn" method of the observable
if you want to have the result on the main android thread for example.

**It is necessary to dispose the subscription on his own?**

Short answer 'yes'. Although the observable called "onComplete" when the surface is destroyed. 
But to avoid memory leaks you should always dispose your subscription.
